Extra Notes:

[9]. (Squares fall off the board, disco board, rotating board, have to solve puzzles before you can
move - Mario Cart mechanics if ahead it gets more difficult, if you are behind you get one square
where you can upgrade the horse to Bishop/Rook)

[11]. On iOS safari go to brower then press the middle far-down button Share > "Add to Home Screen"

[13]. (BUG - might be linked to having to **unsubscribe from socket listeners** in FE)

[22]. Implemented vue vanilla drag & drop but it only worked for desktop:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp React Konva disables scroll on mobile and
places canvas behind all chess pieces. It requries pieces to be stored in state - works well on
mobile. VueDraggable: https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable

[24]. Enable entertaining sound effects via profile page switch/toggle. Put in context and adjust
in Room.vue
