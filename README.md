Easter egg: Powers that were planned to be included in the game
* üí£ Explosive Pawn - Explodes on death, kills capturing piece, except king
* üåå King Teleportation - Teleport two steps in any direction
* üèéÔ∏è Racecar Pawn - Permanent 2 step ability on one pawn, cannot move past enemy pieces
* üöÄ Missle Launch - Select target square for explosion in 3 turns, can only select unoccupied squares
* ü•∂ Piece Freeze - Freeze piece for 2 turns, selected piece is invincible until unfrozen
* ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow Storm - All pieces can move a maximum of 1 square except horses - duration is 3 turns

  
[9]. (Squares fall off the board, disco board, rotating board, have to solve puzzles before you can
move - Mario Cart mechanics if ahead it gets more difficult, if you are behind you get one square
where you can upgrade the horse to Bishop/Rook)

[22]. Implemented vue vanilla drag & drop but it only worked for desktop:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp React Konva disables scroll on mobile and
places canvas behind all chess pieces. It requries pieces to be stored in state - works well on
mobile. VueDraggable: https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable

[24]. Enable entertaining sound effects via profile page switch/toggle. Put in context and adjust
in Room.vue
